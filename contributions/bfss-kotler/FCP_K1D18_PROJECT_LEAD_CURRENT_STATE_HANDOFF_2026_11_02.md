# BFSS Project Lead — current-state delta handoff

**As of:** 2026-11-02 UTC  
**Repository:** \`etblink/math\`  
**Active branch:** \`research/fcp-k1d17-ancestor-cache-pilot-20261028\`

This delta supersedes the F10AW portion of [the 2026-11-01 current-state handoff](FCP_K1D18_PROJECT_LEAD_CURRENT_STATE_HANDOFF_2026_11_01.md). Read that handoff for the broader project scope, accepted theorem inventory, governance, and scientific boundaries. The FCP Project Lead evergreen and procedural success/failure review remain governing methodology; neither is rewritten for this gate.

## Accepted checkpoints unchanged

- F10AU exhaustive oriented original-gamma pair bracket remains accepted at run [#41372474729](https://github.com/etblink/math/actions/runs/41372474729), exact source SHA \`0fab538e626080cc97136755b645dc8372424741\`.
- F10AV original-gamma coefficient LinearMap and skew-image remains accepted at run [#41381629875](https://github.com/etblink/math/actions/runs/41381629875), exact source SHA \`e646bc5b9d21da7b357fbcb572dc399c519c9600\`.
- The native source four-index coordinate-plane bracket remains accepted at its exact pinned source.
- These establish the correct input objects, output carrier, source labels, and \`1/2\` coordinate-plane normalization. They do not establish the original 16-real \`so(9) → so(16)\` LieHom.

## F10AW failure history

The following strict runs are immutable and remain red:

| Run | Tested SHA | First material result |
|---|---|---|
| [#41386533662](https://github.com/etblink/math/actions/runs/41386533662) | \`6a6d437885603c6dbe6d4b259cdb023f89602f15\` | Initial source-level type/case proof failure |
| [#41386877451](https://github.com/etblink/math/actions/runs/41386877451) | \`e097871ffaed77b923d00df40fbc380cfbb9da26\` | Subtype dependent-if coercion still not bridged |
| [#41387034218](https://github.com/etblink/math/actions/runs/41387034218) | \`ab524749fa9701e0da9a9a8b92f5692353466573\` | Overlap case handling and strict linter failure |
| [#41388590016](https://github.com/etblink/math/actions/runs/41388590016) | \`277fef5d9f53de80a0668b4203e6126bfa75665a\` | Subtype coercion type mismatch; substitution-based case proof cascaded |

The causal review is [F10AW Gate 1 red: subtype coercion and dependent-if repair](FCP_K1D18V10H_F10AW_GATE1_RED_SUBTYPE_COERCION_AND_DEPENDENT_IF_REPAIR_2026_11_02.md).

## Gate 2 candidate

The next candidate preserves the exact theorem proposition and accepted dependencies. It replaces the fragile \`simp only\` coercion attempt with ordinary simplification at the explicit Lie-subalgebra-to-matrix boundary, and replaces the hand-written \`subst\` case table with a \`split_ifs\` proof over the source and target dependent-if formulas.

This is an unqualified candidate until the fresh strict run and independent exact-type/root-axiom audit both pass. The source/workflow pins are updated atomically. No root is added by the red run.

## Next mathematical sequence

1. Qualify F10AW generator-pair bracket compatibility for every four source labels, including diagonal and all overlap/collision cases.
2. Define the 16-real matrix bracket defect and prove its typed bilinearity.
3. Use the successful V9I/V9J/V9K/V9L/V9M strategy, together with V9F's exact source skew-plane spanning, to extend generator-pair zero to arbitrary skew inputs. Do not import the 48-real target or its label order into the 16-real gamma target.
4. Only after arbitrary-skew bracket preservation is accepted, construct the exact native Mathlib skew-subalgebra \`LieHom\`.
5. Audit group integration and topology separately. Do not infer Spin(9) global integration, Spin(48) covering, Fock realization, gauge-domain compatibility, or BFSS spectral existence from a generator theorem or Lie algebra map.

## Operational and governance boundaries

- Keep the research branch as the only write target; canonical \`main\` and FCP \`main\` remain untouched.
- No upstream mathcommunity PR without explicit owner authorization.
- Preserve every red run and exact artifact; do not count a build-job total as theorem roots.
- Keep the two lanes distinct: low-cost source-interface diagnosis first, fail-closed formal acceptance second.
- No axioms, admissions, linter suppression, theorem weakening, source-basis substitution, or proof-limit increases.
